and the universe said I love you
and the universe said you have played the game well
and the universe said everything you need is within you
and the universe said you are stronger than you know
and the universe said you are the daylight
and the universe said you are the night
and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
and the universe said the light you seek is within you
and the universe said you are not alone

and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code
and the universe said I love you because you are love.

we are the universe.
we are everything you think isn't you.
sometimes the player dreamed of sunlight and trees.
sometimes the player dreamed it was other things.

to tell them how to live is to prevent them living.
wake up.
